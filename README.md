## **Goldbook** – PHP & HTML Frontend Demo

**Goldbook** is a premium, gold-themed Facebook clone built to demonstrate UI/UX capabilities. This project focuses on high-quality CSS styling and modular HTML structure using PHP for template management.

### 🚀 **Project Nature**

* **Demo Only:** This is a static visual representation.
* **No Authentication:** The login button is non-functional or leads directly to the dashboard for preview purposes.
* **No Database:** This version does not require MySQL or any other database.

---

### ✨ **Key Features**

* **PHP Templating:** Uses PHP `include` functions to manage repetitive UI elements like the header, sidebar, and footer.
* **Gold Aesthetic:** A custom-crafted dark and gold color palette for a luxury feel.
* **Modular Design:** Easy to read code structure, making it simple to swap out "posts" or "friends" in the HTML.
* **Fully Responsive:** Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

* **HTML5:** Structural markup.
* **CSS3:** Custom styles, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.
* **PHP:** Used for server-side includes to keep the code organized.
* **JavaScript:** Minor interactions (dropdowns, modals).
